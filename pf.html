    <h1>Programming Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2>CH 1. An Overview of Computers and Programming Languages</h2>
    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
      Software and programming languages are crucial for modern computing. The
      internet and computers are widely used, even by young students. C++ is a
      programming language for developing software. Before starting to program,
      it's helpful to understand basic computer concepts and history.
    </p>

    <h3>A Brief Overview of the History of Computers:</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.6">
      <li>
        The first device to carry out calculations is abacus. It uses a system
        of sliding beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. (only for
        addition and subtraction)
      </li>
      <break />
      <li>
        Pascaline, developed in 1642 by Blaise Pascal, was a calculating device.
        It had eight movable dials on wheels and could calculate sums up to
        eight figures long. (only for addition and subtraction)
      </li>
      <li>
        Later, Leibniz invented the first device that could handle
        multiplication and division operations
      </li>
      <li>
        In the early and mid-1800s, Charles Babbage, an English mathematician
        and physical scientist, designed two calculating machines: the
        difference engine and the analytical engine. The difference engine could
        perform complex operations such as squaring numbers automatically.
        Babbage built a prototype of the difference engine, but did not build
        the actual device. The first complete difference engine was completed in
        London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed. It consists of 8,000
        parts, weighs five tons, and measures 11 feet long.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first computer-like machine was the Mark I. It was built, in 1944,
        jointly by IBM and Harvard University under the leadership of Howard
        Aiken. Punched cards were used to feed data into the machine. The Mark I
        was 52 feet long, weighed 50 tons, and had 750,000 parts.
      </li>
      <li>
        1946, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC) was
        built at the University of Pennsylvania. It contained 18,000 vacuum
        tubes and weighed some 30 tons.
      </li>
      <li>
        The computers that we know today use the design rules given by John von
        Neumann in the late 1940s. His design included components such as an
        arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, memory, and input/output devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1951, the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) was built and sold to
        the U.S. Census Bureau.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1956, the invention of transistors resulted in smaller, faster, more
        reliable, and more energy-efficient computers. This era also saw the
        emergence of the software development industry, with the introduction of
        FORTRAN and COBOL, two early programming languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1977, Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs designed and built the first
        Apple computer in their garage.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer (PC). In the 1980s, clones
        of the IBM PC made the personal computer even more affordable.

    <h3>Elements of Computer System:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Hardware:</h4></li>
      <p>Hardware consists of CPU, RAM, I/O devices and secondary storage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Input devices are keyboard, mouse, and secondary storage.</li>
        <li>Output devices include screens and printers.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>CPU</h4>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU is the brain of the computer.</li>
        <li>It carries out arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>RAM</h4>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          RAM is directly connected to the CPU. Programs must first be loaded
          inside the RAM in order for them to be sent to the CPU.
        </li>
        <li>
          Main memory is an ordered sequence of cells, called memory cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each cell has a location in the main memory called the address of the
          cell.
        </li>
        <li>When the computer turns off, all data in RAM is lost.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>SECONDARY STORAGE:</h4>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The need for secondary storage can be explained from the fact that all
          data in the main memory is lost each time a computer shuts down.
        </li>
        <li>Secondary storage is directly connected with RAM.</li>
        <li>
          Examples include Hard drives, Solid state drives, flash drives, CD/DVD
          etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>I/O devices:</h4>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The devices that feed data and programs into computers are called
          input devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          The keyboard, mouse, scanner, camera, and secondary storage are
          examples of input devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          The devices that the computer uses to display results are called
          output devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          A monitor, printer, and secondary storage are examples of output
          devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Software</h4>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          System programs control the computer. The system program that loads
          first when you turn on your computer, is called the operating system.
          Without an operating system, the computer is useless.
        </li>
        <li>
          The operating system handles the overall activity of the computer and
          provides services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of these services include memory management, input/output
          activities, and storage management.
        </li>
        <li>
          The operating system has a special program that organizes secondary
          storage so that you can conveniently access information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some well-known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and
          Android.
        </li>
        <li>Application programs perform a specific task.</li>
        <li>
          Word processors, spreadsheets, and games are examples of application
          programs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The operating system is the program that runs application programs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </ol>
        <h3>Processing a C++ Program</h3>
        <p>The following steps, as shown in Figure 1-2, are necessary to process a C++ program.
        </p>

      <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Create Source Code</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Write your C++ program using a text editor.</li>
    <li>Save the file with a .cpp extension.</li>
    <li>Ensure the code adheres to C++ syntax and semantics.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Preprocessing</h4>
    </li>
    <p>The preprocessor handles directives that begin with <strong>#</strong>. <br />
    Common directives include: <br>
     <ul>   
    <li><strong>#include:</strong> Includes header files containing declarations of functions, variables, and classes.</li>
    <li>    <strong>#define:</strong> Defines macros for code substitution.</li>
    <li><strong>#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif:</strong> Conditional compilation.</li>
    The preprocessor expands macros and includes header files, creating a modified source code.
  </ul>  
  </p>

    <li>
      <h4>Compilation</h4>
    </li>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The compiler translates the preprocessed source code into machine-readable object code.</li>
    <li>It checks for syntax errors, semantic errors, and type mismatches.</li>
    <li>The compiler generates object files with a <strong>.o</strong> or <strong>.obj</strong> extension.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <li>
    <h4>Linking</h4>
  </li>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The linker combines multiple object files and libraries into a single executable program.</li>
    <li>It resolves references to external functions and variables.</li>
    <li>Libraries provide pre-written code for common tasks.</li>
    <li>The linker produces the final executable file, typically with a <strong>.exe</strong> extension on Windows or no extension on Linux/macOS.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <li>
   <h4>Loading</h4>
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The operating system loads the executable file into memory for execution.</li>
    <li>The loader sets up the program's environment and initializes necessary data structures.</li>
  </ul>
<li>
  <h4>Execution</h4>
</li>
    <ul>
      <li>lThe CPU executes the instructions in the loaded program.</li>
    <li>The program interacts with the operating system, hardware, and other programs as needed.</li>
    <li>The program continues to run until it terminates normally or encounters an error.</li>
    </ul>

    </ol>
