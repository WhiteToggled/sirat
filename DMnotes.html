                A discrete mathematics course has more than one purpose. Students should learn a particular set of mathematical facts and how to apply them; more importantly, such a course should teach students how to think 
                logically and mathematically.<br>

                Propositional Logic is the logic that deals with statements
                (propositions) and compound statements built from simpler
                statements using so-called Boolean connectives.

                    by the function f to the element a of A. If f is a function from A to B, we write f : A → B.<br>

            solving a problem.

            <h3>Properties of Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
        
            There are several properties that algorithms generally share.<br>
            They are useful to keep in mind when algorithms are described. These properties are:<br><br>

            ▶ Input. An algorithm has input values from a specified set.<br>
            ▶ Output. From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified
              set. The output values are the solution to the problem.<br>
            ▶ Definiteness. The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.<br>
            ▶ Correctness. An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input
               values.<br>
            ▶ Finiteness. An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps
               large) number of steps for any input in the set.<br>
            ▶ Effectiveness. It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a
               finite amount of time.<br>
            ▶ Generality. The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not
               just for a particular set of input values.<br>
